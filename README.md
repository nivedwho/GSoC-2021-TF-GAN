## Project Abstract

[TensorFlow GAN](https://github.com/tensorflow/gan) is a lightweight library for training and evaluating Generative Adversarial Networks. Through this GSoC project I will be implementing more variants of GANs that are more recent and have more applications, using TF-GAN which will be then added as examples to the library.
